    -when we crate a varible in javascriptwe cannot determine what type data it contain, until and unless it is initialized
    -in javascript variable we can store a multiple type of values in a variable, that's why javascript is called loosytypes language

1. var: it create function scope variable
        -we can use variable before its declaration
        -we can re-declare variable.
*Hosting- Moves variable declaration to the top


2. let : it create block scope variable
        -we cannot use variable before its declaration
        -we cannot re-declare variable.

3. const : it create block scope variable
        -we cannot use variable before its declaration
        -we cannot re-declare variable.
        - when we declare a variable, it is compulsory to initialize it.
        -its data will never change on run time



*function

}

functionname();



*how to change attribtute value by using DOM
*how to call function by using event
*how to access data from input control


*array: -it is used to store multiple values with same data type.
        -in array data store on index basis
        -array index always start from zero index
        -we can access array vaues otuside by writting array name[index value]



*object: -it is used to store multiple values with different data type.
        -in object data store in key and value paires
        -we can access object vaues otuside by writting object name.key



*callback function      :       passing funcition name as an argument inside another funciton is called callback funciton
-to achive asyncronous


*date and time
-if we want to diaplay date and time in javascrit first we have to create a object of data class
        let objname = new Date();

        -in string every character has index value and its start from zero.
        -in string blank space is also taken in to account

PROPERTY:
        -length

METHODS:
        -toUpperCase()
        -toLowerCase()
        -indexof(searchinf string[, starIndex]) 
                -it will search string form left to right and return the first occurence of string-
                -if not found it return -1
                -Case Sensitive
        -lastIndexOf(searchingString[, startIndex])
                -it will search string form right to left` and return the first occurence of string-
                -if not found it return -1
                -Case Sensitive
        -search(searchString)
                -it will search string form left to right and return the first occurence of string-
                -if not found it return -1
                -it is faster than indexOf()
                -Case Sensitive

        -slice(startIndex[, endIndex])
                -it will return part of string from begining string
                -it will return part of string from begining string
