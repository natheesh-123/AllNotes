1.Database First Approach:




*incase of file lock 


It looks like the error you're encountering is due to the file MyDemoApp.exe being locked by another process. Here are a few steps you can try to resolve this issue:

1. 
Close the Running Application: Ensure that MyDemoApp is not running. You can check the Task Manager (Ctrl + Shift + Esc) and end the process if it's still running.
2. 
Restart Visual Studio: Sometimes, simply restarting Visual Studio can release the lock on the file.
3. 
Clean the Solution: In Visual Studio, go to Build > Clean Solution, and then try building the project again.
4. 
Delete the bin and obj Folders: Manually delete the bin and obj folders in your project directory. These folders will be recreated when you build the project again.
5. 
Check for Background Processes: Ensure no other processes are using the file. You can use tools like Process Explorer to find and terminate any processes that might be locking the file.
6. 
Restart Your Computer: If the above steps don't work, try restarting your computer to release any file locks.

Give these steps a try and let me know if the issue persists! blush
